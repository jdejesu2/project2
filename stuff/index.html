    <h2>My Favorite Poem!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Before you know what kindness really is </li>
      <li>you must lose things, </li>
      <li>feel the future dissolve in a moment </li>
      <li>like salt in a weakened broth. </li>
      <li>What you held in your hand, </li>
      <li>what you counted and carefully saved, </li>
      <li>all this must go so you know </li>
      <li>how desolate the landscape can be </li>
      <li>between the regions of kindness. </li>
      <li>How you ride and ride </li>
      <li>thinking the bus will never stop, </li>
      <li>the passengers eating maize and chicken </li>
      <li>will stare out the window forever. </li>
      <li>Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness </li>
      <li>you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho </li>
      <li>lies dead by the side of the road. </li>
      <li>You must see how this could be you, </li>
      <li>how he too was someone </li>
      <li>who journeyed through the night with plans </li>
      <li>and the simple breath that kept him alive. </li>
      <li>Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside, </li>
      <li>you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. </li>
      <li>You must wake up with sorrow. </li>
      <li>You must speak to it till your voice </li>
      <li>catches the thread of all sorrows </li>
      <li>and you see the size of the cloth. </li>
      <li>Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore, </li>
      <li>only kindness that ties your shoes </li>
      <li>and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread, </li>
      <li>only kindness that raises its head </li>
      <li>from the crowd of the world to say </li>
      <li>It is I you have been looking for, </li>
      <li>and then goes with you everywhere </li>
      <li>like a shadow or a friend.</li>
