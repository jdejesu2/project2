            My name is Jessica DeJesus. I was born and raised in Chicago IL on the Northwest side also known
            as the Belmont Cragin area. I attended Prosser Career Academy for my
            highschool career. Some of my interest are puppies, chips, and the
            color black. Well, that's all I got for now.
